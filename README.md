Olympics Medal Prediction Project
A data science project aimed at predicting the medal counts for different countries in the Olympics using various machine learning techniques. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to leverage historical Olympic data and advanced machine learning techniques to predict future medal counts for different countries. This can help in understanding trends and factors influencing the performance of countries in the Olympics.

Build Status

Code Style
This project follows the PEP 8 coding style for Python.

Code Example
Here's a brief example of how to use the prediction model:

python
Copy code
from predict2 import predict_medal_counts

# Example input data
input_data = {
    'GDP': 30000,
    'Population': 50000000,
    'Previous Medals': 50
}

# Predict medal counts
predicted_medals = predict_medal_counts(input_data)
print(predicted_medals)
